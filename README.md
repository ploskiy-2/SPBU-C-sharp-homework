# Homework Solutions Repository

Here you'll find solutions to my homework assignments completed during the first three semesters of study at Saint Petersburg State University, all implemented in C#.

## Branches: LinqTask and PLINQ 

In the LinqTask branch, you can explore the use of basic LINQ methods and how to work with them.

In the PLINQ branch, tasks involving the utilization of PLINQ are implemented. These tasks include computing perfect numbers and calculating statistics for the full text of "War and Peace".

## Branch: ContinuationsTask
The ContinuationsTask branch demonstrates the utilization of tasks and continuations, simulating the loading stage of commercial application.

## Branch: FileManager
The FileManager branch presents a file manager based on the following tasks:

1) Navigation through disks, files, and folders.
2) Copying and moving files (using Streams) and folders.
3) Renaming and deleting.
4) Archiving files and folders

Using the OnSerializing and OnDeserialized attributes, encryption and restoration of login and password during writing and reading from the disk are ensured.
They are stored on the disk in encrypted form and decrypted during serialization.

## Branch: DataProcForWebApp
In this branch, a console application has been implemented to process extensive data about movies.

Users can obtain information about movies, actor-directors, and specific movie tags.

Furthermore, a database has been connected using Entity Framework. This has optimized the program's startup time.

Additionally, there is functionality to display the top 10 similar movies for each film.
